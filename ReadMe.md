# .Net6 console app xUnit Unit Test Education Project

by: Jason Cross

This project is intended as an aid to introduce unit testing and tools to help new developers gain familiarity with unit testing and provide examples for self discovery. Indirectly, this could also be an introduction to c# console apps, git and all of the fun things we do as devs.
