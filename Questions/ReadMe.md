# TODO: Create Unit Tests and find the problems with this code

There is a few errors in the BowlingStandard App

* Start creating baseline tests for [Balls.cs](https://github.com/JasonJCross/xUnitTestTrainingMitBowling/blob/main/Questions/BowlingStandard/Balls.cs)
* Then create tests for [Frame.cs](https://github.com/JasonJCross/xUnitTestTrainingMitBowling/blob/main/Questions/BowlingStandard/Frame.cs)
* Then [Frames.cs](https://github.com/JasonJCross/xUnitTestTrainingMitBowling/blob/main/Questions/BowlingStandard/Frames.cs)
* And finally [Bowling.cs](https://github.com/JasonJCross/xUnitTestTrainingMitBowling/blob/main/Questions/BowlingStandard/Bowling.cs)
* This task is completed if you can say what is broken, why it is broken and how you can fix it.

Since this not a test, simply a learning exercise, you are given the answers. Please use these to help you if you are having questions on how to unit test.
